1.  Introduction

   [RFC9052] provides integrity protection for attached, detached and
   hashed payloads that may be shared between parties.  As a COSE
   Envelope is shared, stored and indexed, additional metadata may be
   required to provide context to the attached, detached or hashed
   protected content.

   Section 5.1 of [RFC9052] supports protected and unprotected headers
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052#header-parameters) which
   supports additional labels, however the labels in each of the maps
   MUST be unique.  When processing messages, if a label appears
   multiple times, the message MUST be rejected as malformed, making a
   collection of string keys an invalid COSE structure.

   COSE meta-map provides a CBOR map of key/value string pairs in CBOR
   Representation.  Consideration was give to registering CBOR
   [LABEL.259] as a COSE header.  However the COSE meta-map is
   intentionally constrained to key/value (string:string) pairs,
   providing metadata support within the COSE Headers, while not
   attempting to duplicate a COSE Payload.

1.1.  Examples

   Given the following JavaScript instance:

   new Map( [ ['k1', 'v1'], ['k2', 'v2'] ] )

   The equivalent value as a set in CBOR diagnostic notation is:

   metamap = {
     TBD({"k1": "v1", "k2": "v2"})
   }

   The equivalent value as a set in CBOR diagnostic notation is:

   D9 0103       # tag(meta-map)
     A2         # map(2)
         62      # text(2)
           6B31 # "k1"
         62      # text(2)
           7631 # "v1"
         62      # text(2)
           6B32 # "k2"
         62      # text(2)
           7632 # "v2"

   A COSE Envelope, with a protected header referencing the above
   metamap:

   COSE_Sign1 = [
     protected   : bstr .cbor Protected_Header,
     unprotected : Unprotected_Header,
     payload     : bstr / nil,
     signature   : bstr
   ]

   Protected_Header = {
     ? &(alg: 1) => int
     ? &(content_type: 3) => tstr / uint
     ? &(metamap: TBD) => metamap
   }
